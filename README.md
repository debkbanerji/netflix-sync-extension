## FAQ

### Do you support chat?

The extension doesn't support video or text chat, since external services almost certainly do that better, and you'll probably have a chat that you use to plan your party anyway.

### Do you support syncing across multiple episodes?

We currently don't support syncing across multiple episodes, but you can easily generate a new link once the new episode starts.

### Why did you make this?

We made this for our friends, since other solutions were kind of unreliable when we tried them, and they wanted something simple and stable that could sync our movies during a call.
